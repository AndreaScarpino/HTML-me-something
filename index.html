    <h3 class = "pretty">Manya</h3>
    <p>Manya was born in a small town in Michigan's Upper Peninsula to a wily all-grey
    father and a brooding all-white mother. They were both smaller than the average
    cat, and smarter, with many many projects of their own. Unfortunately, like most parents,
    they were sad and broken, and couldn't care for Manya the way she would have liked.
    She escaped their blistery home one winter morning (it is often
    winter in Michigan's UP) and found her way to a homeless shelter named
    <a href = "http://upaws.org">UPAWS.</a></p>

    <p>Manya was well-cared-for at UPAWS; she was fed pumpkin and tender meats,
    given a room of her own with her own litter tray, and was allowed to play
    with any volunteer with whom she wanted to play. Unfortunately, none of the volunteers
    spoke UP Cat (a particular dialect of Cat) so while she tried to tell them her name
    was Marvelous Moxie, they called her Marie Curie, a common misunderstanding.</p>

    <h3 class = "pretty">Alex</h3>
    <p>Alex was also born in a small town in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. His mother was
    a black bear and his father an exceedingly rare land seal. Although the particulars of their
    relationship have been lost in Lake Superior's waters, they seemed to have
    met in a bar called Crossroads after Alex's mother spent the day ice fishing and
    Alex's father exploring on his snow machine.</p>

    <p>The partnership between a black bear and a land seal was destined to be short-lived,
    and soon after Alex's mother ate his father, she surrendered him to UPAWS as part of
    their Safely Surrenderd Baby Program.</p>

    <p>And this, dear reader, is where their story gets <em>really</em> interesting.
    Or, as the Frenchie Cats say, &quotCette histoire est incroyable! Ge&#769nial!&quot</p>
